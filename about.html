    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        Polygon triangulation is the partitioning of a polygon into a set of triangles (meeting edge-to-edge).
        These simpler shapes are useful in general, as operating on triangles proves much easier than working on the
        entire polygon.
        The broader topic of triangulation in geometry is well studied.
        <br>
        For further research, the art gallery guarding problem, posed by Victor Klee in 1973,
        is a popular visibility problem in computational geometry that uses polygon triangulation in a solution by
        Fisk.

        <strong>Theorem 3.1</strong>
        <em>Every simple polygon admits a triangulation, and any triangulation of a simple polygon with n vertices
            consists of exactly n-2 triangles.</em>
        (de Berg 47)

    <h2>Ear Clipping Method</h2>
    <p>
        Our chosen method for polygon triangulation is the ear clipping method. Max Dehn (though often attributed to
        Meisters) proved the two ears theorem,
        which states that every simple polygon with more than three vertices has at least two ears.
        These ears, vertices, may be removed from the polygon without causing crossing. The resulting polygon
        likewise satisfies this condition.
        The algorithm finds and chops ears off, continuing until one triangle remains. This algorithm does not work for
        polygons with holes.

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>
        We originally hoped to implement the fastest feasible algorithm for polygon triangulation, which involves first
        dividing the polygon into y-monotone subpolygons and then triangulating those monotone polygons.
        This algorithm proved too complicated to comfortably implement, so we decided to use the slower ear clipping
        method for the project.
        You may view some of the unused code for fast triangulation within the javascript files.
        After shifting focus to ear clipping, some of the challenges encountered in the development can be 
        attributed to the JavaScript language, for example the lack of a vector object, how it is an untyped language, and difficulties debugging. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We wanted a step-by-step demonstration of the process on different examples. 
        <br>
        In terms of user interaction, 
        we hoped that users would be able to play with and enjoy the shapes that resulted from the algorithm. 
        For us, tangrams were a natural connection from triangulation.
