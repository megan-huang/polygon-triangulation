    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        Polygon triangulation is the partitioning of a polygon into a set of triangles (meeting edge-to-edge).
        These simpler shapes are useful in general, as operating on triangles proves much easier than working on the
        entire polygon.
        The broader topic of triangulation in geometry is well studied.
        <br>
        For further research, the art gallery guarding problem, posed by Victor Klee in 1973,
        is a popular visibility problem in computational geometry that employs polygon triangulation.

        <strong>Theorem 3.1</strong>
        <em>Every simple polygon admits a triangulation, and any triangulation of a simple polygon with n vertices
            consists of exactly n-2 triangles.</em>
        (de Berg 47)

    <h2>Ear Clipping Method</h2>
    <p>
        Our chosen method for polygon triangulation is the ear clipping method. Max Dehn (though often attributed to
        Meisters) proved the two ears theorem,
        which states that every simple polygon with more than three vertices has at least two ears.
        These ears, vertices, may be removed from the polygon without causing crossing. The resulting polygon
        likewise satisfies this condition.
        The algorithm finds and chops ears off, continuing until one triangle remains. This algorithm does not work
        for polygons with holes.
        As demonstrated by our visualization, this algorithm works by checking whether three points create a convex or
        reflex angle (forming an "ear" or not),
        and then cycles through all the other points in the polygon to check whether the points are within the ear.
        The ear is removed if it passes the conditions—the convex vertex is removed and a new edge is formed between the
        previous vertex and the next vertex. Triangulation continues on the remaining polygon.

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>
        We wanted a step-by-step demonstration of the process on different examples, so we allow users to cycle
        through a variety of polygons by clicking "Switch Polygon". "Animate Polygon" will show an animated step-by-step
        process of the algorithm. "Triangulate" will immediately show the triangulation of the current polygon without
        showing the whole process.
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of user interaction,
        we hoped that users would be able to play with and enjoy the shapes that resulted from the algorithm.
        For us, tangrams were a natural connection from polygon triangulation. When the user clicks on "Tangramify!" the
        triangulated peices of the polygon scatter and the user may attempt to peice together the shape. This button
        will work even if the polygon has not yet been triangulated.
        We included an unmovable version of the original shape at the bottom to guide the process.

    <h2>Development & Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        We originally hoped to implement a fast algorithm for polygon triangulation, which involves first
        dividing the polygon into y-monotone subpolygons and then triangulating those monotone polygons.
        This algorithm proved too complicated to comfortably implement, so we decided to use the slower ear clipping
        method for the project. We hoped to have user input for the polygons, but decided against it for the current version.
        If we wanted to do so in the future, we would have to check if the inputted shapes are in fact polygons and inputted correctly
        for our algorithm. 
        <br>
        Some of the challenges encountered in the development were related to creating user-friendly visuals. Below
        are a few examples of challenges we encountered.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>The Square Problem</strong>:<br>
        Initially, despite good triangulation results (before we added in animation) on more complicated polygons,
        our algorithm would
        not display a nicely triangulated square. This result was especially odd considering this shape should be
        the base case for triangulation—
        a polygon with 4 vertices should have two ears (one diangonal). The issue with the square, we found, was
        that the algorithm cared about how
        the points were defined—it only wanted points that were defined in counterclockwise order.
        For example, the algorithm would not treat the below squares the same. We had to be sure that all polygons were
        inputted accordingly.

        <img src="images/square1.png" alt="square 1">
        <img src="images/square2.png" alt="square 2">
    </div>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Switching Polygons During Animation</strong>:<br>
        We ran into the issue of the triangulation animation continuing for a polygon despite switching to another
        polygon.
        We tried numerous solutions and settled on speeding through the rest of the animation upon switching polygons.
        An unfortunate side effect of our solution is that the "switch polygon" button now has some delay that users may
        notice even when an animation is not in-progress during the switch.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Centering Polygons</strong>:<br>
        The position of the preset polygons are absolute, so some of the polygons appear offcenter.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Timer</strong>:<br>
        When we were working on creating the animation, we struggled to create the effect of a step-by-step animation.
        Using a regular delay does not pause the rest of the code, so everything still appeared on the screen all at once. 
        We eventually settled on using "await" and "async" to create the desired effect.
